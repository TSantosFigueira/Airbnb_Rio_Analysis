# Airbnb Data - Rio de Janeiro Analysis

Analysis of Airbnb room rents data of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This analysis is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program by Udacity.

I explored the dataset to answer a few questions:

- What is the most popular neighborhood for renting a room?
- What is the most popular room type?
- What is the most expensive room type?
- The most expensive rooms are located in which neighborhood?
- What is the expected average price per neighborhood?

You can find an explanation of the results in the following post: https://tsfigueira.medium.com/analyzing-the-airbnb-dataset-of-rio-de-janeiro-e00db78b4370
Also, you can use Nbviewer (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to better visualize the notebook.
